30320,,,Loan,"Also __language__Molbog__ _ny-ahiʔ_, __language__Lotud __ _j-okiʔ_ ‘1sg oblique’.  The reconstruction of this variant, and &ast;_q_-final forms of the first person plural inclusive and exclusive oblique pronouns, is based on material provided by Jason Lobel.  The reconstruction of all forms of the oblique personal pronouns has benefited from unpublished data provided by Lobel, although they are independently reconstructible without this material."
30649,,,Loan,From Spanish _abuso_ ‘abuse’.
30184,,"*tarima ‘receive, accept’",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, perhaps ultimately from __language__Old Javanese__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_tarima_ ‘receive, accept’."
29870,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from _Arabic_, but with the Bornean and Philippine forms acquired indirectly through the medium of __language__Malay__."
29511,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__."
30565,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _el as_ ‘ace’.
29512,,,Loan,Borrowing of __language__Spanish__ _ácido_.
30090,,,Loan,"Presumably a loan from southern Chinese, although a plausible source word is yet to be identified. Thanks to Yen-ling Chen for tracing the history of this form, and drawing my attention to the suggestion that the name may derive from a reduplicated form of __language__Malay__ _kain_ ‘cloth’: _kain-kain_ > _kankan_ > _kaŋkan_ > _kaŋgan_."
29786,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30624,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan distribution.
30691,,,Loan,Apparently a __language__Tagalog__ loan distribution from a form that must originally have had an intervocalic voiced alveolar stop.
30754,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan distribution.
30225,,,Loan,
29513,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Arabic__."
29514,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Arabic__."
29515,,,Loan,Probably a __language__GCPH__  loan in __language__Casiguran Dumagat__ and __language__Kapampangan__.
29716,,*inak 'agreeable',Loan,"[Dempwolff (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_inak_ 'agreeable', but the comparison in question is best explained as a relatively recent innovation or a loan distribution in western Indonesia."
30041,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from Sanskrit."
29607,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__.
29516,,*arak,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Arabic__. Dempwolff treated this form as native, but [Jones (1978)](bib-Jones) regards it as a borrowing of __language__Arabic__ _ʔaraq_ 'strong drink'. This interpretation is supported by the initial consonant of __language__Wolio__ _ʔara_ 'arrack, brandy (made from sago juice, or the nectar of nipah-palm blossom)', and by numerous irregularities in the sound correspondences, although the appearance of forms of the word in __language__Old Javanese__ and __language__Malagasy__ is in need of further study. Such __language__Philippine__ languages as __language__Casiguran Dumagat__, __language__Kapampangan__, __language__Hanunóo__, and __language__Aklanon__ appear to have acquired the word through __language__TAGA__, but __language__Ilokano__ and __language__Bikol__ evidently acquired it directly from speakers of __language__Malay__. Throughout much of eastern Indonesia the word appears to have been borrowed through the mediation of __language__Malay__, and the same may be true of __language__Chamorro__ _arak_, although __language__Ilokano__ _árak_ is another plausible source."
30568,,,Loan,"Presumably a Spanish loan, although the source is yet to be determined."
30601,,,Loan,"Borrowing of Spanish _golpe_ ‘blow, stroke, hit; clash, shock; crowd, throng; accident; surprise’, _de golpe_ ‘suddenly’."
30162,,,Loan,"Borrowing from Sanskrit.  For a detailed account of the complex history of this word, which generally refers to copper in island Southeast Asia, but to a copper-gold alloy in the archaeological cultures of the Andes cf. [Blust (1992a)](bib-Blust)."
30436,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _limosna_ ‘alms’.
30579,,,Loan,Apparently a borrowing of Spanish _darle_/_dale_ ‘go ahead!’.
30530,,,Loan,"Philippine forms are from Spanish _mas que_ ‘although, even so’, and the __language__Malay__ form is evidently from the similar expression in Portuguese.  Surprisingly, the same expression is also found in Tok Pisin _maski_ ‘although’.  Why this particular collocation was so readily borrowed remains unclear."
30168,,*tawas 'alum',Loan,Probably a __language__Malay__ loan distribution.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) proposed __language__PAn__ &ast;_tawas_ 'alum'.
29517,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Arabic__."
29518,,,Loan,Probably a __language__GCPh__ innovation borrowed into __language__Kapampangan__. [Dempwolff's (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff) attempt to relate __language__Tagalog__ _antíŋ-antíŋ_ 'amulet' to __language__Malay__ _antiŋ-antiŋ_ 'ear-ring' and similar forms in other western Indonesian languages through a meaning 'pendant' is unconvincing.
29519,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. No general term for 'animal' has been reconstructed for any early __language__AN__ proto-language, and the __language__Malay__ term _binataŋ_ was thus free to fill a gap in the semantic systems of many languages in Indonesia and the southern Philippines. As is often the case with terms for 'animal' in natural languages, this word functioned both as a category marker and as a term of abuse."
29774,,,Loan,__language__Maranao__ assumed to be a loan from some dialect of __language__Malay__.
29779,,,Loan,"[Merrill (1954:152)](bib-Merrill) notes that all members of the genus _Annona_ which are found in Southeast Asia are natives of tropical America. The plant evidently was introduced by the Spanish into the central Philippines, and probably into Guam during the same period. From there it spread southward through borrowing from __language__Austronesian__ sources, leaving telltale phonological irregularities in __language__Tiruray__ and the __language__Sangiric__ languages ([Sneddon 1984:122](bib-Sneddon))."
29995,,*sau(dj) ‘to answer’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_sau(dj)_ ‘to answer’, including __language__Malay__ _saut_ ‘to answer’.  However, the latter word does not appear in [Wilkinson (1959)](bib-Wilkinson), in [Moeliono et al. (1989)](bib-Moeliono), or in [Hapip (1977)](bib-Hapip).  This appears to be a late innovation in western Indonesia with possible borrowing from __language__Javanese__ into __language__Balinese__."
29608,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30334,,"*pantas ‘be successful, effective’",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Javanese__ into __language__Malay__, and then diffusion through __language__Malay__ to a wider set of languages.

30345,,"*patut ‘proper, fitting’",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Javanese__ into __language__Malay__, with subsequent wide dispersal via __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) compared the __language__Ngaju Dayak__, __language__Malay__, __language__Javanese__ and __language__Toba Batak__ forms with __language__Tagalog__ _patot_ ‘proper, fitting’ and posited Uraustronesisch &ast;_patut_ ‘proper, fitting’, but I have been unable to find the last of these forms in any modern dictionary.  Note the close semantics and probable origin in __language__Javanese__ with subsequent spread by __language__Malay__ for both this form and __language__Malay__ _pantas_, etc."
29634,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30112,,"*kira ‘to presume, surmise, suspect’",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_kira_ ‘to presume, surmise, suspect’."
30580,,,Loan,"[Rubino (2000:150)](bib-Rubino) lists this as a variant of _ramada_, from Mexican Spanish _ramada_ ‘a shelter’."
30154,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from Tamil."
30729,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from Arabic."
29520,,,Loan,Probably early borrowing.
30175,,*tepis ‘go around the edge’,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Javanese__?  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed __language__PAn__ &ast;_tepis_ ‘go around the edge’.
30028,,*suŋsaŋ ‘turned around’,Loan,Probably a __language__Malay__ loan distribution.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited &ast;_suŋsaŋ_ ‘turned around’ based on the data considered here minus __language__Karo Batak__ and __language__Old Javanese__.
29521,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29828,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29522,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__."
30726,,,Loan,The __language__Ayta Maganchi__ word probably is an __language__Ilokano__ loan.
29863,,,Loan,"At first sight this comparison looks flawless, but __language__Saisiyat__ _siwaL_ can only reflect &ast;_Ciwal_, and __language__Kavalan__ _siwar_ must reflect &ast;_siwal_ or &ast;_Siwal_, making a reconstruction impossible.  To date a similar form has not been found in any other Formosan language, and although this forms clearly shows greater similarity than can be expected from chance the conditions under which borrowing might have taken place remain obscure."
30200,,*tazi ‘artificial cockspur’,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. The direction of borrowing for this term strongly suggests that cockfighting was introduced into the Austronesian world in western Indonesia, and from there spread northward into the Philippines and eastward to Sulawesi.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_tazi_ ‘artificial cockspur’ (_Kunstsporn_)."
29865,,,Loan,"Also __language__Malay__ _naŋka_ ‘a fruit; specifically the jack, _Artocarpus integrifolia_; but covering also the soursop, another jackfruit, _Artocarpus lanceaefolia_, and two other plants: _Mallotus macrostachyus_ and _Nauclea purpurascens_ or _Sideroxylon malaccense_’, __language__Karo Batak__ _naŋka_ ‘jackfruit tree and fruit: __language__Balinese__ _naŋka_ ‘breadfruit tree and fruit: _Artocarpus integrifolia_’, __language__Mongondow__ _naŋga_ ‘jackfruit: _Artocarpus integrifolia_’."

29824,,,Loan,Borrowing from a __language__GCPh__  source into __language__Casiguran Dumagat__.
30099,,"*kampuŋ ‘meeting, assembly, gathering’",Loan,"Almost certainly a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff), who reconstructed &ast;_kampuŋ_ ‘meeting, assembly, gathering’, included __language__Tongan__ _kapu_ ‘to surround, etc.’, __language__Futunan__ _kāpu-i_ ‘encircle’, __language__Samoan__ _Ɂapu_ ‘a cup or dish made of a leaf’ in this comparison, but there seems to be little reason to treat the similarity of the Oceanic forms to those in western Indonesia as anything other than chance resemblances.  For the unexpected __language__Iban__ gloss cf. [Blust (1980b)](bib-Blust)."
30418,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Malay__ loanword that has since disappeared in __language__Malay__.
30174,,"*tempuq ‘fall upon, attack’",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_tempuq_ ‘fall upon, attack’."

29524,,,Loan,
30008,,*sedaŋ ‘middling amount’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_sedaŋ_ ‘middling amount’, leaving the last-syllable vowel of the __language__Javanese__ form unexplained.  Since the same problem is found with several other languages, it appears more economical to assume that __language__Malay__ borrowed __language__Javanese__ _səḍəŋ_, with subsequent spread of the loanword into other languages after the merger of last-syllable schwa and &ast;_a_."
29801,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan in __language__Itbayaten__.
29829,,,Loan,"Borrowing. __language__Ilokano__ _palakól_ is almost certainly a __language__Tagalog__ loan. Similarly, [Schlegel (1971)](bib-Schlegel) gives __language__Tiruray__ _felakul_ as a borrowing from __language__Tagalog__. Whatever the source of the __language__Tiruray__ word, it is clearly a loan, and the remaining languages all belong to the __language__Central Philippines__ subgroup."
30457,,,Loan,Borrowing of Hokkien _pú-thâu_ ‘axe’.  This comparison was pointed out by Daniel Kaufman.
29525,,,Loan,"The __language__Philippine__ forms are borrowed from __language__Spanish__, and __language__Tetun__ _bobu_ from __language__Portuguese__. The similarity of these words to other forms in Indonesia is attributed to chance."
29988,,,Loan,"The meaning of this form rules out any possibility of a reconstruction.  Although it may reflect Spanish _chapa_ ‘sheet of metal; thin board’, both the semantic divergence and its absence in __language__Tagalog__, __language__Cebuano__, or __language__Ilokano__, which were more heavily exposed to Spanish influence than either the Dumagat languages or __language__Maranao__, remains puzzling."
30716,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Paiwan__ loan in __language__Puyuma__
30639,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan distribution.
30216,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from Persian.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) marked this as a loan distribution, but provided a reconstruction simply to illustrate the regularity of the sound correspondences.  However, as with other loans used for a similar purpose, the sound correspondences are not entirely regular, the final glottal stop in __language__Tagalog__ being an immediate clue to its loan status."
30657,,,Loan,Borrowing from Chinese.
29526,,*buTak,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30022,,*sulaq ‘be bald’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_sulaq_ ‘be bald’, but the limited distribution of this form is better explained as a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__."
29527,,,Loan,"The __language__Philippine__ forms are borrowed from __language__Spanish__, the Indonesian forms from __language__Portuguese__, either directly or through __language__Malay__."
29528,,,Loan,"Borrowed into __language__Malay__ from an Indian source, and thence transmitted to __language__Cebuano__ (through __language__Malay__-speaking Chinese?) in the restricted context of parlor games."
29937,,,Loan,"Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan distribution, as shown by the irregular lack of a final consonant in both __language__Agutaynen__ (expected &ast;&ast;_sawalik_), and __language__Cebuano__ (expected &ast;&ast;_sawáli_ʔ)."
30201,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) also cites __language__Javanese__ _tələŋ_ ‘kind of climber, creeper’, but I do not find this either in [Pigeaud (1938)](bib-Pigeaud) or [Horne (1974)](bib-Horne)."
29529,,,Loan,Borrowing into __language__Casiguran Dumagat__ from a __language__GCPh__ source.

Given its limited geographical distribution this form is probably best treated as a loanword from __language__Malay__."
30409,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _listón_ ‘ribbon’.

29534,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Dutch__."
30186,,"*taqan ‘to bear, endure’",Loan,"The history of this word is unclear.  A number of forms seem clearly to have been borrowed from __language__Malay__, including modern __language__Javanese__ _tahan_. However, __language__Old Javanese__ _tahən_ suggests that this was a native word before the modern era.  It is possible that the __language__Old Javanese__ form was borrowed by __language__Malay__, underwent the regular merger of &ast;_a_ and schwa in the ultima, and then was disseminated by __language__Malay__ speakers into a wider range of languages, including modern __language__Javanese__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_taqan_ ‘to bear, endure’."
29535,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30703,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. Other __language__Malay__ loans that contain _j-_ were also borrowed with _y-_ in Philippine languages, as __language__Malay__ _jati_, __language__Cebuano__ _yati_ ‘teak’, or __language__Malay__ _juta_ ‘million’, __language__Tagalog__ _yútaɁ_, _saŋ-yútaɁ_ ‘one hundred thousand’.  Since the __language__Malay__ word itself in the latter comparison is a borrowing of Sanskrit _ayuta_ ‘ten thousand’, it is possible that the Sanskrit form was borrowed directly into Philippine languages rather than through the medium of __language__Malay__, but historical records suggest otherwise.  If we side with the historical records, and assume that Sanskrit loans in Philipppine languages were invariably mediated through __language__Malay__, we must conclude that this word underwent a first loanword adaptation in which /_y_/ was replaced by /_j_/, and then a second loanword adaptation in which this change was reversed.  The phonological adaptation of _jadi_, which appears to be a native __language__Malay__ word, supports this interpretation."
29536,,,Loan,"Borrowing. Probably a __language__Malayic__ lexical innovation which diffused to __language__Maranao__ with the introduction of Islam from Brunei. __language__Murut (Timugon)__ _pa-paŋkaw_ 'raised sleeping area' may be unrelated (cf. root &ast;_-kaw_ 'high, tall')."
30157,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _catre_ ‘small bed’.
30086,,,Loan,"Apparently a loanword from __language__Tagalog__ into __language__Ilokano__, although the word is phonologically irregular in both __language__Tagalog__ (where _&ast;-d-_ > _r_), and __language__Cebuano__ (where &ast;_-d-_ > _l_)."

29655,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29628,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. The term &ast;_baraŋ_ apparently was found in __language__PMP__ as a marker of indefiniteness.

30003,,"*siriq ‘pepper, betel pepper’",Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited &ast;_siriq_ ‘pepper, betel pepper’, but this comparison is misguided.  __language__Tagalog__ _síli_, like the similar word in many other Philippine languages (__language__Ilokano__ _síli_ ‘hot chili pepper: _Capsicum_ sp.’, __language__Bontok__ _sili_ ‘chili pepper’, __language__Bikol__ _síli_ ‘chili pepper, hot pepper’,   etc.) is borrowed from Mexican Spanish _chile_, itself a loanword from Nahuatl.  The __language__Javanese__ form is irregular, and the __language__Ngaju Dayak__ word may well be a __language__Banjarese__ loan."

29925,,*gambir ‘refreshing’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_gambir_ ‘refreshing’, but it is now clear that this is a loan distribution due to borrowing from __language__Malay__.  The __language__Tagalog__ form, which he cited from [Laktaw (1914)](bib-Laktaw) does not appear in modern dictionaries."
30309,,,Loan,"The history of this word is puzzling.  _A priori_ it appears to be a straightforward comparison pointing to __language__PAn__ &ast;_pineŋ_ ‘areca nut’, but since better candidates are available for this meaning a reconstruction is immediately suspect.  The gloss of the __language__Pazeh__ form explicitly indicates it as a loanword from Minnan Chinese, and since the __language__Malay__ word appears to be native this raises a question about the direction of borrowing.  The use of betel is not common to Chinese culture as a whole, but is widespread in the Austronesian world, and for this reason it is likely that __language__Malay__ _pinaŋ_ was borrowed by Hokkien speakers, and transported to Taiwan.  There, for reasons that remain obscure, it replaced the native word for this referent (possibly a reflex of __language__PAn__ &ast;_Sawiki_, which is reflected in several divergent Formosan languages)."

29547,,*biru,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. Under this interpretation the _d_ of __language__Mongondow__ _mo-bidu_ presents difficulties, since it would normally be assumed that where variants in _d_, _r_ appear the _d_ variant is historically primary. However, neither __language__Iban__ _biru_ nor __language__Malay__ _biru_ can regularly reflect &ast;_bidu_, and for the present it is perhaps best to assume that __language__Mongondow__ _mo-bidu_ is a result of analogical back-formation from a loanword with _r_.

29945,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan.  Any word which implies metallurgy (as opposed to simple knowledge of iron ore) is almost certainly post-__language__Proto-Philippines__.
29962,,,Loan,"Since this reconstruction implies the use of metallurgy, the comparison almost certainly is a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__. It is noteworthy, however, that in areas that developed metallurgy relatively early, as Borneo, this word does not appear, suggesting that it skipped areas in which native smiths were already producing iron tools, and spread from Malay into the Philippines prior to the advent of metallurgy in that archipelago."

30689,,,Loan,"This etymology is very odd.  Neither __language__Tagalog__ nor __language__Cebuano__ has _r-_ in native forms, yet both have it in this word, and if it is a loan the source is unclear.  Moreover, _rímas_ is in competition with &ast;_kamansi(q)_, &ast;_kulu_, and &ast;_qatipulu_, all of which refer to types of breadfruit in Philippine languages.  One possibility is that there were names for several types of both seeded and seedless breadfruit, and that one of these was &ast;_rímas_, which was borrowed into __language__Tagalog__ and __language__Cebuano__ after &ast;_r_ had already become /_l_/ in those languages.  The __language__Aklanon__ form looks like a hypercorrection, but this would only be possible for speakers who realized that most Spanish names of introduced plants were borrowed in their plural forms (as _bayabas_ < Spanish _guayaba_)."
30222,,*tas ‘sound of breaking or tearing’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_tas_ ‘sound of breaking or tearing’.

30106,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from a Mon-Khmer source ([Thurgood 1999:322](bib-Thurgood)).  __language__Kavalan__ has several loanwords from Philippine languages and from Spanish that date to the brief Spanish occupation of the Ilan basin from 1626-1642, during which time they came up from Manila in an attempt to expand their colonial holdings.  The source of __language__Fijian__ _karavau_ remains unclear.  [Capell (1968:85)](bib-Capell) entertains two speculations: 1. “the name came from Vuda, where the people, seeing reddish cattle, called them after the cloth _karavau_”, 2. “probably Eng. _caribou_”.  The second of these appears particularly improbable."
30667,,,Loan,"Borrowing, either from __language__Malay__ or from __language__Buginese__ itself, although the negative characterizations of Buginese temperament in __language__Ngaju Dayak__ and __language__Kambera__ must be creations in those languages.

29557,,,Loan,"This item appears to be a __language__GCPh__ innovation which has been borrowed from __language__Tagalog__ into __language__Kapampangan__, __language__Pangasinan__ and __language__Ilokano__. The similarity of these forms to __language__Malagasy__ _vónto_, _vóntona_ and __language__Javanese__ _butun_ which led Dempwolff to include them in a single cognate set is attributed to chance."

Why the Malay name suggests a derivation from Bengal remains unclear. The manioc is an Amazonian plant, and presumably was brought to Asia by the Portuguese. The present comparison suggests that it first reached India, then Malaya before Malay merchants introduced it into the southern Philippines."

However, the history of this term is unclear.  Austronesian speakers would not have encountered the cassowary until they reached New Guinea and the Bismarck archipelago, yet reflexes of this form are found far to the west of the Wallace Line, suggesting a later spread of the word through trade.  Even the Oceanic forms that Clark has assembled as support for his reconstruction are wildly irregular, suggesting an equally complex history of borrowing."

However, __language__Malay__ _eru_ regularly reflects &ast;_aRuhu_ (q.v.), and __language__Toba Batak__ _oru_ clearly is a borrowing of the __language__Malay__ form with the normal phonological adjustment made in the assimilation of non-native words with shwa."
30310,,,Loan,"It is unclear when domestic cats first reached insular Southeast Asia, and it is possible that this word originally referred to a native animal.

Collins, that the pre-European spice trade of Indonesia was mediated by Brunei Malays in a commercial arc that linked Brunei (and peninsular Malay ports) with the southern Philippines and northern Moluccas. The maintenance of such contacts on a regular basis would have required sailing along the western and northern coasts of Sabah, through the Sulu Archipelago to southern Mindanao, and from there to Sangir-Talaud and northern Sulawesi before reaching the northern Moluccas.

29880,,,Loan,"__language__Makasarese__ _kaŋkoŋ_ may be a loanword from __language__Malay__, but this appears unlikely in the case of __language__Kapampangan__, where the initial vowel cannot be accounted for in this way.  [Merrill (1954:228)](bib-Merrill) attributes this to borrowing from an unidentified Chinese source.  Although a precise donor language is difficult to identify, a Chinese source appears likely from information that I have received courtesy of Yen-ling Chen, who notes that “Convolvulus (_Ipomoea aquatica_)... in written Chinese can be 空心菜, 蕹菜 or 通菜 (Mandarin: _khong ɕin tshai_ (空心菜), _ioŋ tshai_ (蕹菜), _thoŋ tshai_ (通菜).”  To this she adds that “‘a hole’ in (Taiwanese) Southern Min is _khang_ (孔), and the same character in contemporary Mandarin is pronounced as _khong_.

30072,,,Loan,"Presumably a borrowing of Sanskrit karpāsa into __language__Malay__, from whence it spread to other languages of western Indonesia and the Philippines.  What is surprising about this distribution is that there are widespread forms that point to an apparent &ast;_kapas_, and others that point to an apparent &ast;_kapes_, and in some cases this refers to the native silk-cotton tree, _Ceiba pentandra_.  These discrepancies suggest that the full borrowing history of this form remains to be worked out."

30066,,,Loan,"Unlike most loan distributions that involve __language__Malay__, this one appears to have come about through borrowing by Malays of a term current in the southern Philippines at the time of contact.  Native __language__Malay__ words have neutralized the opposition of /a/ and schwa in prepenultimate syllables, and the absense of neutralization here points to borrowing."

29974,,,Loan,"Also __language__Malay__, __language__Minangkabau__ _suligi_ ‘dart, small spear or lance’.

However, the original meaning of this term appears to have been closer to that of teasing in a flirtatious manner than to mockery or ridicule.  The __language__Kadazan Dusun__ form is irregular, and it is very difficult to exclude the possibility of a borrowing distribution for the remaining forms."

It is therefore best considered a __language__Proto-Malayic__ innovation that has been borrowed over much of the area that it is found, and is indicated as such in at least two of the sources cited here.  In addition, Dempwolff included __language__Malagasy__ _usa_ ‘cowardly, timid, faint-hearted; feeble, weak’ in his comparison, but this appears to be unrelated."

The wide distribution of this loanword, its semantic variability and the degree to which it has become integrated into the morphology of the languages which have borrowed it give some idea of how difficult it can be to identify native language material (e.g. from __language__Malay__) which diffused prior to the period of western contact."

The presence of a mid-front vowel in many of the terms cited here points to borrowing from __language__Malay__. At the same time the occurrence of reflexes in __language__Malagasy__ and __language__Old Javanese__  indicates that diffusion of the term (and the associated practice of domesticating ducks) must have begun by the 7th century A.D.

Third, although __language__Malay__ loanwords are common in many Philippine languages, this word is not reported in Standard Malay ([Wilkinson 1959](bib-Wilkinson)).

29624,,,Loan,"Borrowing. The phonology of this form (with its mid-front vowel and prenasalized initial consonant in several languages) unmistakably indicates a lexical distribution resulting from diffusion. However, unlike most widespread loan distributions in island Southeast Asia it is difficult to attribute this one to borrowing from either __language__Malay__ or __language__Javanese__. The terms in eastern Indonesia almost certainly were borrowed from some language of Sulawesi, most likely __language__Buginese__ or __language__Makassarese__. The origin of the term in the languages of Sulawesi, however, remains unclear. The forms in __language__Minangkabau__ and __language__Malay__ suggest that this word, like the similar term for 'duck', is onomatopoetic. An independent term for 'goat' (&ast;_kandiŋ_) is found in a number of the languages of Borneo and the Philippines, but the domestication of goats is certainly of secondary origin in island Southeast Asia. Perhaps, like the domestication of ducks, it was introduced during the Indianization of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula by the 7th century A.D."
30050,,,Loan,"The history of goats in insular Southeast Asia remains to be worked out in detail, but the evidence currently available suggests that they were introduced from South Asia around the beginning of the Christian era ([Blust 2002:104-105](bib-Blust)).  What makes this loanword particularly odd is that doublets &ast;_kambiŋ_ and &ast;_kandiŋ_ are both widely distributed in insular Southeast Asia, and only the first of these variants can plausibly be attributed to borrowing from __language__Malay__."
29625,,,Loan,"A very widespread loanword which [Wilkinson (1959)](bib-Wilkinson) traces to __language__Sanskrit__ _mashaka_ 'mace', and thence to 'gold', since the latter was measured by the mace. Whatever its origin, it seems clear that the known distribution of this term is largely a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Lee (1966)](bib-Lee) reconstructs __language__Proto-Chamic__ &ast;_ʔama-h_ 'gold', and [Mills (1975)](bib-Mills) reconstructs __language__Proto-South Sulawesi__ &ast;_immas_ 'gold', but in at least the latter case, and probably in both, the word almost certainly was borrowed from __language__Malay__ after the proto-language in question had already divided into daughter languages. The glosses of __language__Bikol__ _amás_ and of such South Sulawesi forms as __language__Tae'__ _ammaʔ_ and __language__Buginese__ _emmeʔ_ suggest that the early __language__Malay__ prototype referred to a unit of measure for gold, probably developed after the initiation of Indian contact in the early centuries of the Christian era.

30193,,*tanduk ‘horn’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Urasustronesisch’ &ast;_tanduk_ ‘horn’, but given its known distribution it is better regarded as a Greater North Borneo innovation, and hence came into being after the Austronesian settlement of Borneo.  The forms in Philippine languages, Sumatra, Java and Bali are best treated as __language__Malay__ loans, and [Lobel (2016)](bib-Lobel) similarly considers all forms of _tanduk_ in __language__Sabah__ as borrowings from __language__Malay__."
29645,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Javanese__. As noted by [Dempwolff (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff), this item evidently = _ajar_ 'teach, learn' + _-an_."

29646,,,Loan,"Borrowed into __language__Kapampangan__ from __language__Tagalog__. This form probably reflects earlier &ast;&ast;_balutkut_, with root &ast;[-kut](root-acd-r_k.htm#-kut) 'hunched over, bent'."
29891,,,Loan,"Also __language__Sa'a__ _huru-huru_, __language__Arosi__ _huru_, _huru-huru_ ‘to run’, which appears to be a chance resemblance.  __language__PAn__ &ast;_qaNup_, __language__PMP__ &ast;_qanup_ meant ‘to hunt for game’, and the forms cited here either are products of borrowing from __language__Malay__, or reflect an innovation in Greater North Borneo with subsequent extension of the distribution as a result of borrowing from __language__Malay__."
30315,,,Loan,The presence of mid-back vowels in all these forms points to borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29778,,,Loan,Borrowing into __language__Casiguran Dumagat__  from a __language__GCPh__ source (probably __language__Tagalog__).
30185,,,Loan,The __language__Casiguran Dumagat__ form is assumed to be a loan from __language__Tagalog__ or __language__Bikol__.
30727,,,Loan,"This is a very mysterious comparison.  Given its gloss, which almost certainly implies a literate society, the distribution seen here must be a product of borrowing, but its source, and why it is known so far only in __language__Palawano__ and __language__Tboli__ among members of the Philippine subgroup, is still unresolved.  Given their mobility, this may have originated with the Sama-Bajaw, and spread by borrowing from them to a few select land-based populations."
29754,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Malayo-Chamic__  innovation that has been borrowed from __language__Malay__ into __language__Dairi-Pakpak Batak__ and __language__Mongondow__.

It is assumed that __language__PMC__ was spoken in southwest Borneo, and that populations speaking __language__PMC__ dialects began to expand into eastern Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and coastal regions of the Gulf of Thailand as far north as the central portions of modern Vietnam in the first or second century B.C. It is noteworthy that at least two of the indigenous languages of Borneo have doublets, one reflecting an earlier, and the other a later loan, thus supporting Borneo as the geographical locus of this innovated lexical item."

29660,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Arabic__."
30152,,,Loan,"As argued by [Lebot et al. (1997)](bib-Lebot), the kava plant is a product of human cultivation and refinement which probably began in Vanuatu and then spread into other parts of the Pacific after the arrival of Austronesian speakers.

30018,,*sipak ‘kick’,Loan,"This comparison is a particularly striking example of a widespread __language__Malay__ loanword that has acquired cognate morphology in such widely separated languages as __language__Ilokano__, __language__Tagalog__ and __language__Malagasy__, and could easily be mistaken for a native word if irregularities in the sound correspondences did not expose its historically secondary status.  Based on data from __language__Javanese__, __language__Malay__, __language__Ngaju Dayak__ the clearly irregular __language__Malagasy__ form, and __language__Fijian__ _sevaki_ [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_sipak_ ‘kick’."

30137,,*kuraŋ ‘shortage; too little’,Loan,"Although it is tempting to propose a reconstruction for this set of terms, this is one of the most widely distributed __language__Malay__ loanwords in island Southeast Asia, having spread to many coastal languages of Borneo, and on into the Philippines, presumably in a trading context in which it may have played an especially prominent role.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited &ast;_kuraŋ_ ‘shortage; too little’."
30210,,,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) marked this as a Sanskrit loan, citing it only to illustrate the regularlity of sound correspondences.  However, the final glottal stop in __language__Tagalog__ _talágaɁ_ is irregular, and shows it to be a loanword.  In addition, the range of languages over which this form is found supports the suspicion that many other comparisons which are confined to __language__Malay__ and a few languages that are known to have borrowed from it are in fact loan distributions through the medium of __language__Malay__."
29662,,,Loan,"Borrowed, ultimately from __language__Persian__."
30120,,*kuzu(r) ‘name of a lance’,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_kuzu(r)_ ‘name of a lance’.

However, this explanation assumes that borrowing took place in both __language__Lampung__ and __language__Sundanese__ before the distinctive sound change &ast;_R_ > _y_ (from &ast;_kuRa_).  Somewhat enigmatically, [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_ku(r)a_ ‘milt, spleen, land turtle’, combining two very distinct senses in a single gloss."

30365,,,Loan,"Also __language__Malay__ _məmpəlam_ ‘mango’.  Given its very restricted distribution in western Indonesia, this is assumed to be a __language__Malay__ loanword."
30464,,,Loan,"Although the mango is native to island Southeast Asia, [Richards (1981)](bib-Richards) gives __language__Iban__ _maŋga_ as a borrowing of Tamil _man-kay_, and [Wilkinson (1959:737)](bib-Wilkinson) says the same of __language__Malay__. If this is valid then the Philippine forms must have been borrowed from __language__Malay__."
29813,,"*ulaq 'employment, occupation'",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff) included these forms together with __language__Samoan__ _ula-vale_ 'make a nuisance of oneself, make trouble' under a proposed reconstruction &ast;_ulaq_ 'employment, occupation', which I reject."
30067,,,Loan,"This is another of many problematic [Dempwolff](bib-Dempwolff) comparisons.  The sound correspondences are irregular, and even if __language__Ngaju Dayak__ had not borrowed substantially from __language__Javanese__ during the Majapahit period (1293-c. 1500), a reconstruction based only on these languages could not be assigned to any of the proto-languages recognized in the ACD."
30197,,"*tanDa ‘sign, signal, mark’",Loan,"Borrowing, probably from old or modern __language__Javanese__, where it referred to a military ensign.

To these [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) added __language__Tagalog__ _labol_ ‘iron’, a form that does not appear in modern dictionaries, and posited ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_labur_ ‘to liquefy, melt’.  Only the __language__Ngaju Dayak__, __language__Nias__ and __language__Sundanese__ forms appear likely to be related, and these are likely loans from __language__Malay__."

29938,,,Loan,"This native of Mexico, known in English as the ‘Mexican yam’, the ‘yam bean’, or the ‘Mexican turnip’, was introduced during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, along with its name (_jícama_), ultimately from Nahuatl _xīcamatl_.  Given the importance of the Manila Galleon trade, which connected Manila and Acapulco by annual voyages from 1572 to 1815, the introduction of this plant and its name almost certainly took place through __language__Tagalog__, with subsequent borrowing into other Philippine languages from the region of Manila Bay. It is noteworthy that it evidently was not introduced into Guam despite this island being a regular stopover in the Galleon trade. The borrowing of nouns in their plural form is common to many Spanish loanwords in both Philippine and Mexican Indian languages ([Lopez 1965](bib-Lopez))."
29830,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__."
30429,,,Loan,Apparently a __language__Malay__ loanword.

30685,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, although a still to be identified Indic source is strongly suspected."
29942,,,Loan,"Also __language__Hanunóo__ _sadisádi_ ‘miscellany; multifarious, various’.  The history of this form is puzzling.  Although it may have begun with the general meaning ‘various, miscellaneous’, in many languages it probably is a __language__Tagalog__ loan that became widespread after the Spanish colonization and the introduction of a money economy.  In any case, an assignment to __language__Proto-Philippines__ would be incautious without further evidence of forms that are not likely to be borrowed."
29679,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__."
30487,,"*leŋas ‘moist, damp’",Loan,"Probably a __language__Malay__ loan.  I am unable to find __language__Tagalog__ _laŋás_ in sources available to me, and even if that were possible, the penultimate vowel correspondence is irregular, suggestive of borrowing or chance resemblance.  On the basis of this comparison [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) proposed  ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_leŋas_ ‘moist, damp’."
30424,,*licak ‘wet and slippery’,Loan,Probably a __language__Malay__ loan distribution.  Based on this comparison [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited Uraustronesisch &ast;_licak_ ‘wet and slippery’.
30512,,,Loan,From Spanish _Lunes_ ‘Monday’.
29680,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__."
29681,,,Loan,"Almost certainly a borrowing of Southern __language__Minangkabau__ _wan_, probably early in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). According to Robert Cheng (p.c.) some __language__Minangkabau__ dialects, such as that of __language__Swatow__, permit only the velar nasal in final position. The final velar in _uaŋ_ may thus have been present in the lending language. The pronunciation _uaŋ_ is, of course, an accomodation to the predominant disyllabic canonical shape of most __language__Austronesian__ languages, although a canonically atypical variant _waŋ_ persists here and there. With the advent of Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia and English colonial rule in Malaysia the meaning of _uaŋ_, evidently began to shift from a specific unit of currency (which presumably was no longer used) to the more general sense which it has in most languages today."
29682,,,Loan,"Borrowing. The route of transmission of this form remains unclear. There is every reason to believe that Bornean forms such as __language__Kelabit__ _bedhuk_, __language__Berawan (Long Terawan)__ _becuʔ_, __language__Bintulu__ _bəɗuk_, __language__Melanau (Mukah)__ _beduk_ and __language__Kayan__ _beruk_ are native, and reflect a prototype of the shape &ast;_beduk_. It is, moreover, likely that __language__Malay__ originated from a population movement out of southwest Borneo beginning in the first or second century BC ([Blust 1994](bib-Blust)). Early __language__Malayic__ speakers in Borneo evidently borrowed this word from a language in which &ast;_-d-_ > _r_ (as __language__Kayan__). The form is reflected with this irrgularity in __language__Iban__ (a continuation of the Malayic population that remained in Borneo) in __language__Malay__, in __language__Lampung__ of southern Sumatra, and in __language__Balinese__ (which exhibits a second irregularity). The simplest hypothesis appears to be that speakers of __language__Malay__ introduced a native Bornean monkey, and with it an irregularly altered form of its name, to Sumatra and perhaps some other parts of western Indonesia."
29976,,,Loan,"Possibly a __language__Tagalog__ loan in __language__Kapampangan__ and __language__Agutaynen__, in which case this form may have been a Central Philippine innovation."

However, the __language__Fijian__ word is phonologically irregular, and best treated as a chance resemblance.  More generally, since iron nails were unknown in the Austronesian world before Western contact, the referent of this terms would have been a wooden dowel or peg, and __language__PAn__ &ast;_pasek_ offers a far less problematic proto-form for this meaning."

While the __language__Tagalog__ and __language__Mansaka__ forms clearly are cognate and evidently are native, __language__Casiguran Dumagat__ pawed shows an irregular last-syllable vowel that suggests borrowing from __language__Tagalog__, and the __language__Kankanaey__ form may be a product of chance."

However, cognates are known in very few languages, and the __language__Malay__ and __language__Javanese__ words are not phonologically compatible, __language__Javanese__ having a schwa in the penult, but __language__Malay__ having a mid-front vowel that could only come etymologically from _&ast;i_.  Despite the vocalic disagreement, this is best treated as a __language__Malay__ loan distribution."
30381,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29692,,,Loan,Borrowing. The nutmeg tree was confined to the Banda archipelago in the central Moluccas until the beginning of the European involvement in the spice trade early in the 17th century.

However, I am unable to find __language__Tagalog__ _sulol_ in [Panganiban (1966)](bib-Panganiban) or [English (1986)](bib-English), the __language__Samoan__ form probably is a chance resemblance, and several of the remaining forms show contradictory reflexes for the final consonant, __language__Ngaju Dayak__ supporting &ast;_R_, but Old and Modern __language__Javanese__, __language__Sundanese__ and __language__Balinese__ supporting &ast;_r_."
29694,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__."
30102,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29752,,*sadiRi 'house post',Loan,"Apparently a late innovation in western Indonesia, perhaps spread in part by borrowing from __language__Malay__. The agreement of __language__Iban__ and __language__Sasak__ in pointing to final _-ʔ_ suggests that this form is distinct from &ast;_sadiRi_ 'house post', although the two cognate sets were combined by [Dempwolff (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff)."
30603,,,Loan,"From Spanish _cebollas_, like most Spanish nouns, borrowed in its plural form."
29695,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from __language__Arabic__."
30525,,,Loan,"Probably a __language__Malay__ loan, although the orangutan is native to both Borneo and Sumatra"
29927,,,Loan,"__language__Itbayaten__ normally palatalizes &ast;_ŋ_ adjacent to a high-front vowel, and the absence of palatalization here is an indication that this form almost certainly is borrowed from a Central Philippine source, most likely __language__Tagalog__.  I am indebted to Alexander Smith for bringing this to my attention."
30522,,,Loan,"Borrowing from Sanskrit, in most cases through __language__Malay__."
29698,,,Loan,Probably early borrowing.
29856,,*banTiŋ ‘wild cow’,Loan,"Dempwolff posited &ast;_banTiŋ_ ‘wild cow’, but the available evidence suggests that this form originated in Java and spread from there to  __language__Malay__  and to languages that were in close contact with  __language__Malay__ .  Wild bovids are found both on the island of Mindoro in the  Philippines and in Borneo, and permit the reconstruction of __language__PWMP__ &ast;_tamadaw_ ‘kind of wild ruminant.’"
30296,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29701,,*palaŋka 'palanquin',Loan,"Borrowing. [Dempwolff (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_palaŋka_ 'palanquin', but marked it as a __language__Sanskrit__ loan. [Zoetmulder (1982)](bib-Zoetmulder) gives a similar etymology for __language__Old Javanese__ _palaŋka_, _palyanka_, _paryanka_. If the original meaning was 'palanquin' and all of the items included here are related, it is remarkable how semantically divergent the reflexes of this form have become. Moreover, if it is a loan it is striking how culturally integrated the __language__Ngaju Dayak__ word appears to be. __language__Karo Batak__ _pelaŋkah_ 'feeding trough for pigs; trough in which gambier is crushed by trampling; coffin carved from a tree trunk', __language__Toba Batak__ _palaŋka_ 'wooden trough' are best treated as chance resemblances."
30367,,*pucat ‘pale’,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__. Based on this comparison [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) proposed Uraustronesisch &ast;_pucat_ ‘pale’.

However, it is now clear that __language__PAn__ &ast;_qaRem_ (q.v.) meant ‘pangolin’, with specific reference to the _Manis pentadactyla_ of Taiwan, but later applied to the _Manis javanica_ throughout much of Borneo."
29703,,*betik,Loan,"Borrowing. The papaya is not native to Southeast Asia, but was introduced from the New World during the Age of Exploration (source: ). [Wilkinson (1959)](bib-Wilkinson) suggests a derivation from the __language__Arabic__ word for 'watermelon', borrowed into Portuguese as _pateca_, and then applied to the papaya. __language__Minangkabau__ _buah ketéla_ ('Castilian fruit') suggests a __language__Spanish__ introduction, a not unlikely possibility given the clearly __language__Spanish__ origin of the word in most _Philippine_ languages (_papayas_, _kapayas_, etc.)."

Almost certainly a loan distribution, presumably borrowed from __language__Malay__ before __language__Malay__ itself replaced this word with _gadai_."
30541,,,Loan,"Borrowing of Spanish _maní_ ‘peanut’, an Amazonian cultigen.  The meaning ‘clitoris’ is clearly secondary, and based on physical similarity."
30513,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from Sanskrit."
30440,,,Loan,"From Spanish _lapiz_ ‘pencil, graphite’."
30342,,*peliR ‘penis’,Loan,"Despite its basic semantics, and the regular sound correspondence of _r_ in __language__Malay__ to zero in __language__Javanese__, this comparison is almost certainly a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__. Apart from being in competition with __language__PAn__ &ast;_qutiN_ ‘penis’, it is not reported in __language__Old Javanese__ ([Zoetmulder 1982](bib-Zoetmulder)), and is not known in any other language.

29709,,*uRaŋ,Loan,"A late innovation in western Indonesia, with borrowing from __language__Malay__ into some languages (including at least __language__Makassarese__). [Dempwolff's (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff) attempt to include __language__Ulawa__ _ule-_ 'brother, sister, cousins of all sorts' under &ast;_uRaŋ_ is almost certainly in error."
30373,,,Loan,Also __language__Isneg__ _pésoɁ_ ‘peso’.  Borrowing of Spanish _peso_ ‘one hundred centavos’.
30303,,,Loan,Probably an __language__Amis__ loan in __language__Puyuma__.
30357,,*pin(tT)a ‘to request’,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__ into non-Malayic languages.  Based on the __language__Tagalog__, __language__Malay__, and __language__Toba Batak__ forms given here [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) proposed Uraustronesisch &ast;_pin(tT)a_ ‘to request’, although he acknowledged that the __language__Tagalog__ form is a loan."
29886,,,Loan,"Also __language__Ngaju Dayak__ _sumput_ ‘pick up, take’.  __language__Tagalog__ _dampót_ cannot be reconciled with the __language__Ngaju Dayak__ or __language__Javanese__ forms, and the latter cannot be reconciled with __language__Malay__ _jemput_. Moreover, [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) included __language__Fijian__ _covu-ta_ ‘to break or cut food small; to peck at’, which appears to be unrelated.  All things considered, then, this comparision is most likely to be a product of borrowing from  __language__Malay__."

29867,,,Loan,
29997,,"*saka ‘post, pillar’",Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited &ast;_saka_ ‘post, pillar’, but [Zoetmulder (1982)](bib-Zoetmulder) gives __language__Old Javanese__ saka as a borrowing of Sanskrit _sākhā_ ‘branch’.  Even if its loan status from Sanskrit is not established, its antiquity in the Austronesian family is far from demonstrated with this geographically restricted distribution."
30123,,,Loan,"Also __language__Ngaju Dayak__ _kutip_ ‘pinching with the fingernails; pinched off’.  [Dempwolff](bib-Dempwolff) compared the __language__Ngaju Dayak__ and __language__Malay__ forms with __language__Fijian__ _koti_ ‘to clip, to shear’, __language__Tongan__ _kosi_ ‘to cut with scissors or shears or clippers, to clip or shear; to cut grass with a lawn-mower; (of rats) to gnaw through, to gnaw a hole in’, __language__Samoan__ _oti_ ‘to cut (with scissors, clippers, etc.)’, but these are better assigned to &ast;_ketil_."

The similarity of __language__Atayal__ _qalaŋ_, __language__Truku Seediq__ _alaŋ_ ‘village’ to these and to one another also cannot be accounted for by recurrent sound correspondences."

30443,,,Loan,"Probably a borrowing of __language__Malay__ _reboŋ_ ‘bamboo shoot when young, soft and edible’."
30142,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__. The __language__PMP__ and __language__PPh__ term for ‘turmeric’ was &ast;_kunij_.
30277,,,Loan,"Since the _Leucaena leucocephala_ is native to southern Mexico and northern Central America it must have been introduced to the Marianas islands during the Spanish colonial period.  The name for it presumably was borrowed from speakers of __language__Tagalog__, who compared it with the more familiar castor oil plant, itself a likely earlier introduction to insular Southeast Asia from India."
30709,,,Loan,

30588,,,Loan,From Spanish _arado_
29717,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Spanish__ (__language__Philippine__ forms) and __language__Portuguese__ (__language__Malay__).
30713,,,Loan,"From Spanish _punta_ ‘point, tip, end; headland’."
30344,,*pa(n)tik ‘be pointed’,Loan,"The __language__Fijian__ form is best assigned to __language__POc__ &ast;_bati_ ‘canine tooth’, and its connection with the other forms given here remains dubious.  The remaining forms are most like products of borrowing from __language__Malay__. On the basis of this set [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited Uraustronesisch &ast;_pa(n)tik_ ‘be pointed’."

30431,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30454,,,Loan,"Also __language__Maranao__ _dalimaɁ_ ‘pomegranate: _Punica granatum_ L.’.  This plant is native to the Middle East, and must have been introduced to insular Southeast Asia after the Austronesian settlement of the region.  [Zoetmulder (1982)](bib-Zoetmulder) gives __language__Old Javanese__ _dalima_, _dālima_ as a borrowing of Sanskrit _dāḍima_ ‘pomegranate’, and [Wilkinson (1959)](bib-Wilkinson) attributes __language__Malay__ _dəlima_ to the same source.  It therefore seems likely that this fruit was introduced during the Indianization of Sumatra, Java and the Malay peninsula.  From there it presumably would have spread through Malay trade contacts both to the Moluccas, where a Malay presence in connection with the spice trade began by at least the 7th century AD, and to the Philippines, where Malay-speaking Islamic missionaries had begun to penetrate shortly before the arrival of the Spanish."
29718,,,Loan,
30104,,*keren ‘charcoal basin’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_keren_ ‘charcoal basin’, but this clearly is borrowed throughout the Philippines, and is most plausibly traced to a __language__Malay__ source."
30330,,"*paŋkat ‘elevation, rank’",Loan,"Also __language__Sasak__ _paŋkət_ ‘sort into layers (of objects)’.  Most of this comparison almost certainly is due to borrowing from __language__Malay__. However, the semantic divergence of the __language__Tagalog__, __language__Mapun__, __language__Mansaka__, __language__Tausug__, __language__Ngaju Dayak__, and __language__Sasak__ forms, along with the phonological divergence of the latter, raise the possibility that this is an older word that underwent semantic changes in  __language__Malay__, and then spread by contact.

I take the __language__Fijian__ form to be a chance resemblance."
30107,,*kendi ‘water jug’,Loan,"Also __language__Toba Batak__ gondi ‘water jug’.  Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from Hindi.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_kendi_ ‘water jug’."
29719,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__. This comparison is remarkable for at least two reasons: 1) although it seems clearly to be a __language__Sanskrit__ loan which acquired much of its attested distribution as a result of borrowing from __language__Malay__, it originally referred to animal (particularly snake) venom, a referent for which a native term would normally be expected, 2) the word is very widespread in the Philippines and both western and eastern Indonesia, and has acquired a variety of secondary meanings including that of general force or power, skill, knowledge and ability. In __language__Malay__ and some other languages (e.g. __language__Rembong__) this abstraction and generalization of the original concrete nominal sense has gone even further, leading to the use of _bisa_ as an auxiliary verb meaning 'can, be able'."

29738,,,Loan,"__language__Karo Batak__, __language__Kambera__ and __language__Tetun__ are likely to be __language__Malay__ loans. __language__Kambera__ _(m)balahu_, on the other hand, appears to be native. It is possible that a __language__PMP__ &ast;_balas_ existed alongside &ast;_bales_."
29858,,*ba(dD)ak 'rhinoceros',Loan,"Also __language__Old Javanese__ _wadak_ ‘wild buffalo’.  Austronesian speakers would not have encountered any type of rhinoceros until they reached Borneo.

29859,,*banza(r) ‘row’,Loan,"Based on the __language__Malay__, __language__Toba Batak__, __language__Javanese__ and __language__Fijian__ forms [Dempwolff (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff) posited &ast;_banza(r)_ ‘row’, but the resemblance of __language__Fijian__ _basa_ to the other forms cited here seems best attributed to chance, and the remainder of the comparison is geographically very restricted and best attributed to borrowing from __language__Malay__. __language__Arosi__ _hata_ ‘to be in line, continuous’ offers a semantically better fit with the western Indonesian forms than __language__Fijian__ _basa_, but without collateral lines of support this, too, is best treated as a product of convergence."
30243,,,Loan,From Spanish _timón_ ‘rudder’.
30658,,,Loan,This limited distribution probably is due to borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29969,,,Loan,"A __language__Malay__ loanword, ultimately from Arabic.  Note how the positive features of the meaning in __language__Malay__ assume a more negative cast in most other languages."
30087,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29744,,,Loan,"Borrowing. Although an Indian source has not been identified, the semantics suggest that this item was acquired either by direct lexical borrowing or by lexical innovation in response to novel cultural influences during the Indianization of western Indonesia. This inference is further strengthened by the appearance of a mid-front vowel in virtually all known cognates, a clear indication of secondary origin. The most likely locations in which the form might first have appeared are southern Sumatra and Java, with subsequent borrowing into other areas."
29847,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Persian__ through __language__Hindi__."
30001,,,Loan,"Possibly a __language__Javanese__ loan into __language__Malay__, which then functioned as the vector in spreading it into northern Sumatra and the Philippines."
29745,,*uyaq 'salt',Loan,Borrowing from __language__Javanese__ into __language__Ngaju Dayak__. [Dempwolff (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed __language__PAn__ &ast;_uyaq_ 'salt'.
29848,,,Loan,"Apparently a __language__Proto-Northwest-Formosan__  innovation of the shape &ast;_bunaj_. This shows regular reflexes in  __language__Saisiyat__  and  __language__Pazeh__ , but  __language__Thao__ _bunaz_ is a loan, presumably from  __language__Saisiyat__ .  The meaning ‘sand’ was designated in __language__PAn__ by &ast;_qenay_."
30124,,"*kesik ‘coarse sand, gravel’",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) proposed &ast;_kesik_ ‘coarse sand, gravel’."
30255,,,Loan,"Although the __language__Maranao__ and __language__Malay__ forms show regular sound correspondences that apparently point to &ast;_talumpaq_, footwear was unknown among Austronesian-speaking peoples prior to modern times.  The further irregular of the medial liquid points further to a still unclear history of borrowing. Almost certainly a Philippine loanword in __language__Buruese__, perhaps via contact with the Sama Bajaw."
29746,,*agas,Loan,"Probably a __language__Malayic__ innovation, with subsequent borrowing from __language__Malay__."
30438,,,Loan,Borrowing from Chinese.
30504,,,Loan,"Borrowing of __language__Malay__ _gərgaji_ ‘a saw; to saw’, ultimately from Sanskrit _krakaca_."
30153,,,Loan,"[Mintz and Britannico (1985)](bib-Mintz) derive the __language__Bikol__ form from a Hokkien original, and [English (1986)](bib-English) holds a similar view of the __language__Tagalog__ form, although this has not been confirmed."
30751,,,Loan,"Almost certainly a __language__Malay__ loan distribution.  Although the pangolin, or scaly anteater, is native to Palawan, reflexes of __language__PAn__ &ast;_qaRem_ ‘pangolin, scaly anteater’ are found further south in many of the languages of Borneo, and imply that __language__Palawano__ _teŋgiliŋ_ is an innovation.  Since a subgroup containing Malayic and Palawanic languages is unsupported, a borrowing explanation (or a lexical distinction between different types of pangolins) is the only plausible alternative."
29747,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Mota__ loan diffused through the use of __language__Mota__ as the language of instruction in the nineteenth-century London-based Melanesian Mission.
29931,,*guntiŋ ‘scissors’,Loan,"The history of this word is still obscure.  It is almost certainly a loan from some non-Austronesian source, and its distribution in most languages, including all those of the Philippines and eastern Indonesia, probably is a product of borrowing from __language__Malay__.  However, it is also found in __language__Old Javanese__ texts that are centuries old, and its application to terms in carpentry (__language__Bikol__) and house construction (__language__Asilulu__) raises questions about a possible earlier meaning that was later transferred to scissors once these were introduced."
30139,,*kala ‘scorpion’,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from Sanskrit.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) proposed &ast;_kala_ ‘scorpion’, marking it as a Sanskrit loan, but no satisfactory native term has yet been reconstructed for this meaning."
30737,,,Loan,"From Spanish _tiempo_ ‘time, period, epoch; weather’."
29749,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, with the possible exception of __language__Tagalog__ _bíriʔ_, which may be a chance resemblance."
29750,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30007,,*si(ŋ)kap ‘to seize’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited _&ast;si(ŋ)kap_ ‘to seize’, but __language__Ngaju Dayak__ _siŋkap_ appears to be a __language__Banjarese__ loan, and both of the forms cited here are better assigned to &ast;_sikep₁_."
29881,,,Loan,"Also __language__Old Javanese__ _ka-juwal_ ‘sold’ (__language__Malay__?).  The antiquity of this form is unclear.  It’s distribution is entirely within an area that has been subject to Malay-dominated commerce for many centuries, and so the possibility is very real that many of these forms could ultimately be __language__Malay__ loanwords.  The word was present in __language__Old Javanese__ in a form that differs from __language__Malay__ _jual_, suggesting that it has been circulating in western Indonesian for over a millennium, but this is still consistent with a __language__Malay__ source, since Sriwijaya dominated commerce in the Malay archipelago by at least the 7th century AD.
The semantics of Sumatran forms such as __language__Gayō__ _juel-en_ also suggest that if this word is a __language__Malay__ loan it was borrowed early enough to become thoroughly enmeshed in the cultural traditions of the borrowing society."
30611,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__.
30125,,*ki(r)im ‘to send’,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited &ast;_ki(r)im_ ‘to send’.

29755,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Tamil__."
30433,,,Loan,Borrowing from Spanish.
29756,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__. Although [Wilkinson 1959](bib-Wilkinson) does not list __language__Malay__ _biri-biri_ the form is given in the sources for several other languages of Indonesia as a __language__Malay__ loan.
30647,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Ilokano__.
30738,,,Loan,"The origin of this term is unclear.  Domesticated cats probably arrived in the Philippines with the Spanish, so this word probably arose."
30220,,*tembak ‘to shoot’,Loan,"Western Indonesian forms have been borrowed from __language__Malay__, and the resemblance of the __language__Paiwan__ form to these is best attributed to chance. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Uraustronesisch’ _&ast;tembak_ ‘to shoot’."
30369,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30483,,,Loan,This comparison (with a consistent mid-front vowel) is most plausibly attributed to borrowing from a somewhat earlier stage of __language__Buginese__ or __language__Makassarese__.
29758,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__.
30555,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _pala_ ‘shovel’.

30718,,,Loan,"Presumably a loan, but the source language is unclear."
30126,,*kesaq ‘breath loudly’,Loan,"[Dempwolff](bib-Dempwolff) proposed &ast;_kesaq_ ‘breath loudly’, adding __language__Javanese__ _gesah_, _geresah_ ‘to groan, moan’.  I am unable to find the latter in either [Pigeaud (1938)](bib-Pigeaud) or [Horne (1974)](bib-Horne)."
30747,,,Loan,From Spanish _carátula_ ‘mask’.
30358,,*pirak ‘silver’,Loan,"This extremely widespread loanword appears to be of Mon-Khmer origin ([Thurgood 1999:360](bib-Thurgood)).  It evidently was acquired by __language__Malay__ as a result of contacts on the mainland of Southeast Asia, and then spread throughout much of western Indonesia-Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan through trade contacts, perhaps mediated by the Dutch presence in southwest Taiwan from 1624-1661, and the Spanish presence in northeast Taiwan from 1626-1642 (the latter out of Manila).  Surprisingly, it is almost totally absent from eastern Indonesia, suggesting that apart from the spice trade, which drew Malays into the Moluccas at an early time, Malay trade routes tended to favor a north-south route.  Based on the comparison of the __language__Tagalog__, __language__Malagasy__, __language__Malay__, __language__Toba Batak__ and __language__Javanese__ forms given here [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) proposed Uraustronesisch &ast;_pirak_ ‘silver’."
30442,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Javanese__. The mechanism of diffusion in this case may have been Javanese influence during the peak of the Majapahit period (1293-1500).  However, it is possible that the Dutch colonial administration was responsible to some extent for the spread of this form, which was used for the colonial _rijksdaalder_, and which was borrowed into some of the Papuan languages of the North Halmahera family, as with Galela _salaka_."
29854,,,Loan,"A likely loan distribution, probably starting from __language__Paiwan__."
30246,,"*tuŋgal ‘submit, humble oneself’",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_tuŋgal_ ‘submit, humble oneself’ (sich beugen).  His inclusion of __language__Toba Batak__ _tuŋgal_ was based on the notion that male animals travel alone, while females move with their cubs."
30140,,*ku(r)us ‘slender’,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, ultimately from Sanskrit.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_ku(r)us_ ‘slender’."
30605,,,Loan,"From Spanish _saya_ ‘skirt, dress, tunic’."

30016,,*si(r)am ‘to spray’,Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed _&ast;si(r)am_ ‘to spray’, but this is best treated as a loan distribution from __language__Javanese__ or __language__Malay__."

30600,,,Loan,Apparently from Spanish _brocal_ ‘parapet (round well)’.
30405,,,Loan,Borrowing from Hokkien.
29772,,,Loan,A relatively late innovation in western Indonesia. __language__Rembong__ _intik_ is either a phonologically altered loan or a product of convergence.
30247,,*tikam ‘to stab’,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_tikam_ ‘to stab’ (_erstechen_) based on the forms given here and __language__Tagalog__ _tikam_ ‘battle, fight’ (_Schlacht_).  However, the latter form does not appear in any modern dictionary."
29773,,*bintaŋ,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. This comparison is especially problematic, since it involves an item of basic vocabulary which appears to have been widely borrowed, in most cases presumably replacing a reflex of __language__PAn__ &ast;_bituqen_. In addition to competition with the more widely distributed &ast;_bituqen_, phonological irregularities and the frequently reflected secondary meaning 'medal, decoration' suggest that this comparison is a product of diffusion. On the other hand, the basic character of the term, and its integration into a number of culturally significant expressions (names for stars important in the traditional agricultural calendar, the __language__Karo Batak__ term for rice-milling songs, etc.) give one hesitation about a borrowing hypothesis in particular cases. More precisely we should say that &ast;_bintaŋ_ was an innovation in a language which gave rise to Malay and certain of its closest relatives. With the ever-increasing influence of __language__Malay__ after the rise of Indianized states in southern Sumatra the word then spread to languages which did not inherit it directly (including __language__Malagasy__, which presumably acquired it during the 7th century A.D. in southern Sumatra)."
30674,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan distribution.
30374,,,Loan,"Borrowing of Spanish _pisón_ ‘rammer (for flatteneing earth, etc.)’."
30248,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) included __language__Tagalog__ _tindak_ ‘to tread’, tirak ‘to tread’, and __language__Malagasy__ _tsindzaka_ ‘dance in which one stamps’, but neither form appears in any dictionary I have consulted.  With root[ &ast;-zak](root-acd-r_z.htm#-zak) ‘step, tread’."
30224,,*te(n)duq ‘stillness of wind’,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, except __language__Fijian__ _toro_, which is best treated as a chance resemblance.   [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_te(n)duq_ ‘stillness of wind’ (_Windstille_)."
30627,,,Loan,"Apparently a __language__Tagalog__ loan distribution, from a form that must originally have had an intervocalic voiced alveolar stop."
29823,,,Loan,"This evidently was the __language__PAn__ word for 'wind', replaced in __language__PMP__ by &ast;_haŋin_. The available forms in __language__MP__ languages suggest that they were borrowed in the meaning 'typhoon', presumably well after the dispersal of __language__PMP__."
29775,,,Loan,"Apparently a borrowing of Spanish _vida_ ‘life; way of life; living, human being’."
29776,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__.

30183,,,Loan,"From Spanish _torcer_, ‘twist’."
29777,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30484,,,Loan,"This is not a word that would ordinarily be borrowed, since __language__PAn__ &ast;_tebuS_ clearly referred to sugarcane, and there was no need to borrow a word that referred to a plant which was everywhere available.  I assume that sugarcane disappeared at some point in the human history of the Batanes islands, and that it was then re-acquired from northern Luzon, along with the lexical innovation that designates this plant in the Cordilleran (Northern Luzon) languages."

29782,,,Loan,"__language__Makassarese__ _boyoŋ_ appears to be a loan from __language__Malay__. The resemblance of the other forms both to this word and to one another is regarded as a product of chance, although the sequence _-VyV-_ is known to be symbolic of swinging or swaying movement in other morphemes ([Blust 1988:57-58](bib-Blust))."
30526,,,Loan,Because its known distribution is highly restricted this variant of the more common &ast;_mamis_ is best explained as a loan from __language__Malay__ or __language__Javanese__.
30280,,,Loan,Borrowing from Minnan Chinese (Hokkien) _dao⁵ hui¹_ ‘bean curd’.
29888,,,Loan,"The _Annona squamosa_ and its close relatives (_Annona muricata_, etc.) is native to the tropical Americas and West Indies, and must have been introduced into the Philippines by the Spanish during the operation of the Manila Galleon trade."

30622,,,Loan,Probably an __language__Ilokano__ loan in the Batanic languages.
30158,,,Loan,"Probably a __language__Malay__ loan, although it is unclear if this is true why a loanword from far south of the Philippines would be concentrated only in the region of Palawan and Mindoro."

This item has the same historical source as the various forms of _biaya_ cited under 'monetary support' (cf. __language__Old Javanese__ _byaya_ 'expenses, contribution'). The attested distribution of both sets of forms almost certainly is the result of borrowing from __language__Malay__, which in turn acquired the word twice, the first time directly from __language__Sanskrit__ with relatively minor phonetic modifications, and the second time through __language__Javanese__. The two words so acquired were then transmitted, probably as a linguistic by-product of Islamic proselytization, from __language__Malay__ into various other languages of Indonesia and the Philippines."

30059,,,Loan,"Since it is a native of Mexico the tomato was almost certainly first introduced into Southeast Asia through the Spanish presence in the Philippines, and more specifically through the annual Manila Galleon voyages that connected Manila, a source of Chinese silks, with Acapulco, a source of Mexican and Peruvian silver, from 1565-1815.  The tomato would then most likely have made its landfall in the Philippines in one of the returning galleons that brought its cargo into Manila Bay, where the native population was __language__Tagalog__-speaking.  Presumably the name was misheard and bruited about in the form _kamátis_, in which form it eventually spread throughout the Philippines, but not beyond (note that __language__Chamorro__, spoken in Guam, which was a regular galleon stopover, does not show this sporadic change)."

30415,,*lansat ‘name of a tree and its fruit’,Loan,"The history of this word is problematic.  Western Indonesian languages point clearly to &ast;_laŋsat_, but many Philippine languages have forms such as __language__Bikol__ _lansónes_ ‘small edible fruit growing in bunches, possessing a leathery yellow skin and a white segmented inside: _Lansium domesticum_’.  The plant is native to Southeast Asia, but variants of the names _duku_ and _laŋsat_ (cf. __language__Malay__) are found in Thai and Burmese, as well as Austronesian languages.  This leaves little doubt that it is a loanword, but the source remains unknown.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) posited Uraustronesisch &ast;_lansat_ ‘name of a tree and its fruit’."

However, three independent pieces of evidence show that the words in __language__Tagalog__, __language__Ngaju Dayak__, __language__Malagasy__ and __language__Javanese__ are almost certainly __language__Malay__ loans.  First, __language__Tagalog__ shows _-_Ɂ corresponding to __language__Malay__ final vowel.  Second, the word is unknown in any language of the Philippines apart from __language__Tagalog__. Third, __language__PMP__ &ast;_dalikan_ is a far better candidate for the meaning ‘trivet, three stones of the hearth’."

In addition to this set  __language__Proto-Rukai__  &ast;_cəkələ_,  __language__Puyuma__ _dekal_ show similarities without regular sound correspondences, and these suggest borrowing of a different form meaning ‘village,’ implying that the notion of ‘village’ was not found in __language__PAn__, and once it was lexically encoded it tended to spread easily by borrowing."

29807,,,Loan,__language__Kalamian Tagbanwa__ _elat_ is assumed to be a loan from a Greater Central Philippines language.
30740,,,Loan,"From Spanish _bastón_ ‘walking stick, baton’"
29808,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Makassarese__.
30349,,*pe(rR)aŋ ‘war’,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed Uraustronesisch &ast;_pe(rR)aŋ_ ‘war’.
29809,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Spanish__.
30391,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _lavar_ ‘to wash’.
29811,,*pan-eŋet 'wasp',Loan,"[Dempwolff (1934-38)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_pan-eŋet_ but the __language__Malay__ form, as indicated by [Wilkinson 1959](bib-Wilkinson), is morphologically complex whereas the __language__Malagasy__ form is not. The latter was almost certainly borrowed from __language__Malay__ prior to the change of last-syllable &ast;_e_/ to //_a_//. For abundant evidence of __language__Malay__ loans in __language__Malagasy__ cf. [Adelaar (1989)](bib-Adelaar)."
29879,,,Loan,"Given its limited distribution in western Indonesia this cognate set is best attributed to borrowing from __language__Malay__, to a late innovation, or to some combination of these two."
30708,,,Loan,
29815,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Tamil__."
29816,,,Loan,__language__Bimanese__ _ɓunti_ and __language__Balinese__ _bunciŋ_ are assumed to be loans from __language__Makassarese__. The similarity of __language__Numfor__ _buk_ to these forms is attributed to chance.
29860,,,Loan,Most or all of these forms appear to be loanwords from __language__Malay__.
30629,,,Loan,"Also __language__Hanunóo__ _ilamn-án_ ‘be weeded’.  Since the Ayta Abellen were traditional foragers this word is almost certainly a loan from an agricultural neighbor, although it is currently unknown in __language__Tagalog__."
30721,,,Loan,"From Spanish _pozo_ ‘well, sump’."
29817,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30456,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _látigo_ ‘whip’.
30662,,*cambuk ‘whip’,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938](bib-Dempwolff)) posited ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_cambuk_ ‘whip’.
30350,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
29818,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__ into __language__Kapampangan__ and __language__Casiguran Dumagat__.
29819,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__.
29953,,,Loan,"From Spanish _chiflo_ ‘a whistle’, with adaptations to the canonical shape of Philippine languages."
30311,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _pito_ ‘whistle’.
29820,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. Although the origin of this word remains unclear, its referents suggest that it did not exist in its present meaning prior to the commercial civilization of Hinduized western Indonesia during the Sriwijaya period (7th to 13th centuries A.D.)."
30556,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Tagalog__, ulimately from Hokkien (Southern Min) _ba⁵ giao⁴_."

30748,,,Loan,"Borrowing of Spanish _garrafa_ ‘decanter, carafe’."
30426,,*liaR ‘wild’,Loan,"Probably a __language__Malay__ loan distribution.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) also included __language__Tagalog__ _iyág_ ‘lust, sensuality’, which seems unconnected, and __language__Fijian__ _lia-lia_ ‘foolish’, which does not appear in [Capell (1968)](bib-Capell), and in any case differs considerably in meaning.  Nonetheless he posited Uraustronesisch &ast;_liaR_ ‘wild’."
29822,,"*benaŋ, menaŋ",Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Javanese__, in some cases (e.g. __language__Toba Batak__ _monaŋ_) probably through __language__Malay__."
30427,,"*li(ŋ)ke(r) ‘wind around, coil up’",Loan,"Probably a __language__Malay__ loan distribution.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) added __language__Samoan__ _liɁo_ ‘circle, ring’, and posited Uraustronesisch &ast;_li(ŋ)ke(r)_ ‘wind around, coil up’, but without further support from Oceanic witnesses the resemblance of the __language__Samoan__ form to the other words cited here is better treated as a product of chance."
30573,,,Loan,Probably a __language__Tagalog__ loan distribution in languages outside the Central Philippine group.
29872,,,Loan,Borrowing from __language__Malay__.
30089,,"*kawad ‘wire, fiber’",Loan,"[Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) compared the __language__Tagalog__, __language__Ngaju Dayak__, __language__Malay__ and __language__Javanese__ forms with __language__Tongan__, __language__Futunan__ _kava_, __language__Samoan__ _ava_ ‘beard’, and proposed &ast;_kawad_ ‘wire, fiber’.  However, the Polynesian forms are not clearly related, and since the remaining words are 1. connected with metallurgy, and 2. phonologically irregular since the final consonant is voiceless in some languages in which it would be expected to be voiced (if from &ast;_kawad_) it must be assumed that this word is a loan, although its source is yet to be determined."
30593,,,Loan,Borrowing of Spanish _alambre_ ‘wire’.
29943,,,Loan,"Also __language__Maranao__ _taksiʔ_ ‘witness’.  This Sanskrit loanword entered __language__Malay__ and __language__Old Javanese__ during the Indianization of western Indonesia.  It was later spread to the Philippines through Malay traders, who probably concentrated their efforts mostly in the __language__Tagalog__-speaking region of Manila Bay.  From __language__Tagalog__ it reached areas of the northern Philippines that apparently never came under direct __language__Malay__ contact influence.  Given his usual practice of including pseudo-reconstructions for loanwords with a distribution that would justify an attribution to his ‘Proto-Indonesian’ if they were native, it is noteworthy that [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) did not include this form.  The reason for this exclusion may have been phonotactic, since a reconstruction &ast;_saksi_ would violate his otherwise exceptionless template of CVCVC forms or CVCCVC forms which were either reduplicated monosyllables or unreduplicated bases with homorganic medial prenasalization.  Finally, the extent to which this form has been integrated into native morphological paradigms is a warning that loanwords cannot easily be detected by their exclusion from indigenous word-building mechanisms."
30557,,,Loan,"From Spanish _tarugo_ ‘wooden peg or pin, stopper’."
29851,,,Loan,"A loanword, probably from  __language__Bunun__  into  __language__Paiwan__, although this remains unclear."
30029,,*surat ‘writing’,Loan,"Also __language__Javanese (Krama)__) _serat_ ‘letter’.  Most of this comparison is due to borrowing, ultimately from __language__Malay__. [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed &ast;_surat_ ‘writing’, and [Blust (1976:33)](bib-Blust) noted that “Since all reported ‘indigenous’ scripts in Indonesia and the Philippines ... appear to be based on Indian originals, there is no known physical reason to suppose a pre-Indian tradition of ‘bamboo literacy’.  &ast;_surat_ is not a Sanskrit loanword, however, invariably and exclusively refers to writing, and must have existed in western Indonesia only slightly later than the earliest inscriptions in an Indian-based script.  It therefore seems unlikely that writing was introduced to Indonesia entirely as a result of direct or stimulus diffusion from India.”"
30199,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__, although the gloss of the __language__Toba Batak__ form suggests that this may have been a more widespread form that originally referred to natural markings, as on animal pelts.  [Dempwolff (1938)](bib-Dempwolff) proposed an etymological chimera, comparing the western Indonesian forms with __language__Tagalog__ _túlis_ ‘point, sharp end; spire;; anything tapering and pointed’, which is better assigned to __language__PWMP__ &ast;_tirus_ ‘tapering, attenuating to a point’, and with __language__Samoan__ _tusi_ ‘point (with finger); draw; write’, etc., and other Polynesian forms that are best assigned to __language__PCEMP__ &ast;_tusi_ ‘draw, make marks or designs’."
30143,,,Loan,"Borrowing from __language__Malay__. The relationship between this term and __language__PMP__ &ast;_kunij_ ‘turmeric: _Curcuma longa_ (tuber that yields a yellow dye)’ remains unclear.  The latter term regularly became __language__Karo Batak__ _kuniŋ_ ‘turmeric’, since final voiced stops were nasalized in Northern Batak.  It is possible that it was acquired in this form by early __language__Malay__ speakers, although borrowing from __language__Karo Batak__ to __language__Malay__ seems very unlikely. Terms for __language__PMP__ &ast;_kamuniŋ_ ‘a tree: _Murraya_ spp.’, on the other hand, appear to be monomorphemic, but may have been reinterpreted in languages that have kuniŋ as affixed forms of this base."
29826,,,Loan,"Borrowing, ultimately from __language__Sanskrit__."
