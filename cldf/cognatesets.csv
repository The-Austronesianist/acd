24941,article,,*a₁,"The history of this morpheme is problematic.  In the Solomons and in Central Pacific languages reflexes of &ast;_a_ function as a personal article, in contrast to the common noun article &ast;_na_.  [Pawley (1972:58)](bib-Pawley) reconstructs ""PEOc"" &ast;_na_/_a_ ‘common article’, and &ast;_(q)a_ ‘personal article’, thus positing a rather dubious distinction between contrasting articles &ast;_a_ and &ast;_(q)a_.  Similarly, [Walsh and Biggs (1966)](bib-Walsh) posit PPn &ast;_ʔa_ ‘personal article’, but reconstruct &ast;_ʔ-_ purely on the basis of [Tongan](languages/434) _ʔa-_. Since [Tongan](languages/434) is known to have added initial glottal stop in the reflexes of some other grammatical morphemes ([Clark 1976](bib-Clark)) the evidence for distinguishing &ast;_a_ ‘common article’ and &ast;_qa_ ‘personal article’ appears to be dangerously thin.  This morpheme may be a sporadic shortening of &ast;_na_ which happened independently in a number of [Oceanic](languages/OC) languages.  If so, however, it is puzzling that it often replaced &ast;_i_ as a personal article rather than continuing to function as a common noun article.",PMP,Canonical

As a result many irregular reflexes ([Atayal](languages/493), [Tagalog](languages/423), [Javanese](languages/285), [Gorontalo](languages/272), etc.) remained unexplained.  I assume ultimate stress, since the genitive marker &ast;_ni_ is the non-contrastive element in genitive constructions.  Given an etymon of such a shape and obviously high list and text frequency, it is not difficult to see how the initial consonant and following vowel sporadically contracted to a palatal nasal which then underwent a regular merger with &ast;_n_ in many daughter languages.",PMP,Canonical

The explanation for this treatment is given in [Dempwolff (1934-38:sect. 47e)](bib-Dempwolff), where it is suggested that &ast;_matay_ is derived from &ast;_patay_ by nasal substitution, but is sufficiently widespread (being found in ‘Indonesian’, ‘Melanesian’ and Polynesian languages) to require a separate reconstruction.

As noted in [Blust (1977)](bib-Blust), and reinforced in [Ross (2006:533)](bib-Ross), all known Malayo-Polynesian reflexes show an irregular change of [PAn](languages/PAN) &ast;_iten_ to [PMP](languages/PMP) &ast;_aten_, presumably as a result of paradigmatic leveling (&ast;_iten_ : &ast;_amen_ > &ast;_aten_ : &ast;_amen_).",PWMP,Canonical

His inclusion of [Tagalog](languages/423) _balúlaŋ_ ‘Verstärkungsstrick’ and [Malagasy](languages/18432) _valolana_ ‘bedstead with an embroidered canopy’ can, however, be questioned on semantic grounds.

The forms in the remaining languages cited by Dempwolff probably contain a root &ast;_-luN_ (cf. &ast;_luluN_ ‘roll together’).  Since [Amis](languages/227) _falod_ is the only non-[MP](languages/MP) reflex of &ast;_baluN_ discovered to date the [PAn](languages/PAN) gloss of this item is rather general (‘bind; bundle’), but by [PMP](languages/PMP) times the form apparently referred to the wrapping of a corpse and to the death shroud or wrapping cloth itself.

Collins (p.c.) notes that similar, but apparently non-corresponding forms are found in some languages on the north coast of Seram (Salas _palút_, Benggoi _balútam_, Kobi _balóta_).

Finally, the semantic evolution of this form from ‘coconut husk’ to ‘rubbish’ and even ‘excrement’ seems to have followed a natural path determined by the almost daily use of coconuts: the nut cannot be used for meat or milk unless the husk is first removed, and this is most commonly discarded as refuse, since only a small percentage of the many husks that are removed would be needed for cordage and the like.",POC,Canonical

As with its doublet &ast;_beties_, the fundamental referent of this form appears to have been the leg between the knee and ankle.

Like other perceptually salient members of larger semantic categories to which they belong (e.g. &ast;_sawa_ ‘python’, some reflexes of which evolved into the generic term for ‘snake’), the notion ‘calf of the leg’ came to usurp the more fundamental sense ‘lower leg’ in many languages.  When this happened reflexes of &ast;_beties_ or &ast;_bities_ without the modifier &ast;_buaq_ took on the sense ‘calf of the leg’, and could be used themselves as modifiers roughly equivalent to &ast;_buaq_ (e.g. [Toba Batak](languages/427) _bitis ni taŋa_ ‘muscles of the lower arm’ next to [Acehnese](languages/225) _bòh pisaŋ_ ‘muscles of the upper arm’).",PMP,Canonical

This term appears to have represented both the idea of a temporary interference with vision caused by a mote in the eye, and the more permanent condition of blindness.  Only the latter meaning is known to have persisted in [PCEMP](languages/PCEMP).

Although evidence for the unaffixed base is scanty, it seems clear that [POc](languages/POC) distinguished &ast;_puput_ and &ast;_puput-i_.  In accordance with a widespread drift toward a disyllabic canonical target in [Oceanic](languages/OC) languages which incidentally produced a correlation between reduplication and intransitivity ([Blust 1977a](bib-Blust)), reflexes of &ast;_puput-i_ have often lost the initial syllable by haplology.  Once this change occurred the same canonical pressure produced a tendency to reinterpret the suffix as part of the base, allowing further suffixation on top of the morphologically incorporated &ast;_-i_ in [Fijian](languages/266) and the Polynesian languages.  By this point the surviving remnants of the unreduced base were reinterpreted as partial reduplications (e.g. [Hawaiian](languages/620) _huhuki_, cited by [Pukui and Elbert (1971)](bib-Pukui) as a reduplication of _huki_, whereas historically the latter actually is a reduction of the former).

To judge from the attested semantic reflexes, this visually striking shell probably was used both for ornamentation and for various utilitarian purposes connected with fishing (net sinker, lure for squid or octopus).  The three reflexes from northern Luzon are at least in part due to borrowing from [Ilokano](languages/279), and they could be treated as distinct from this comparison.  However, to do so would slight the striking formal and semantic agreement between [Ilokano](languages/279) _bulí_ and [Rotinese](languages/395) _fuli_.  It is assumed that the semantic change in Philippine languages reflects a transfer of function from the old material used for net sinkers (cowrie shells) to a newer replacement.

Cross-cutting agreements in various languages of western and eastern Indonesia suggest that &ast;_buliR_ also designated an ear of grain, particularly the rice-head.  Although these glosses to a large extent are in complementary distribution, the reconstruction of homophones in such a case clearly would be unsatisfactory.

Although [PMP](languages/PMP) &ast;_buRuk_ evidently referred in particular to the addling of eggs, and reflexes of &ast;_busuk_ are more often associated with malodorous rot, there is considerable overlap in the extension of these terms to various types of decay (as in wood), putrefaction (as of flesh), etc.  The available reflexes suggest that in addition to its literal referents &ast;_busuk_ also was applied to undesirable personal traits or to the maligning of reputations.",PMP,Canonical
25777,be afflicted with a swollen abdomen as a result of violating customary law.,,*busuŋ,"The meaning of this term is discussed in [Blust (1981)](bib-Blust).  Briefly, it is argued there that [PWMP](languages/PWMP) &ast;_busuŋ_ referred to the culturally-defined consequences of violating customary law, in particular to offenses against kin-based social hierarchy.  As is apparent from the reflexes cited here, it was believed that the offense would be supernaturally redressed through an affliction of the offender which appears in the form of abdominal swelling.  In Christianized societies such as that of the Cebuano Bisayan the traditional belief has been reinterpreted in terms of a personal God exacting retribution, but the available evidence for animistic societies suggests an antecedent stage in which the punishment was impersonal and automatic.  Reflexes in some languages, as [Malay](languages/326), suggest an inversion of cause and effect whereby sufferers of physical ailments which caused abdominal swelling were regarded as in some sense deserving of their condition.",PWMP,Canonical

[PAn](languages/PAN) &ast;_busuR_ appears to have meant only ‘hunting bow’.  While the same meaning persisted in [PMP](languages/PMP), many reflexes of this form both in [WMP](languages/WMP) and in [CMP](languages/CMP) languages refer to a bow-shaped implement used to card cotton or kapok fibers.  Since _Gossypium_ species are adventitious to Southeast Asia, and presumably were introduced during the early stages of Indian contact in western Indonesia, it is unlikely that the use of &ast;_busuR_ for carding _Gossypium_ fibers has an antiquity of more than two millennia.  It is, however, possible that such an instrument was used earlier for carding the fibers of the indigenous kapok.  Phonologically irregular forms such a [Manggarai](languages/816) _wusu_ suggest that the practice of carding kapok fibers with a bow-like instrument may have spread from Indianized regions such as Java or the various Malay states of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.  If so, it is surprising that the association of a reflex of &ast;_busuR_ with the carding of kapok fibers is found among the geographically more remote mountain peoples of northern Luzon, whereas reflexes in the more accessible lowland areas often refer to a hunting bow (e.g. in [Tagalog](languages/423) and [Bikol](languages/244)).  Everything considered it seems safest to conclude that [PAn](languages/PAN) &ast;_busuR_ referred exclusively to a hunting bow, but that by [PMP](languages/PMP) or at least [PWMP](languages/PWMP) times this form had taken on the additional meaning of a bow-like instrument used to card the fiber of the silk-cotton, or kapok tree.",PAN,Canonical

Hammocks ae not found in east Brazil, with the exception of the Cre’pumkateye, who are known to have borrowed them.  They are likewise rare in the Chaco, although used as baby cradles by some groups.”  Since hammocks are absent elsewhere in the Austronesian world it seems most reasonable to infer that this word originally referred to a swinging cradle for an infant, and was then extended to include the hammock, which presumably was introduced during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.

Although European folk traditions tend to see the dugong as a type of aquatic cow (probably because it grazes the sea grass on the ocean floor), Austronesian speakers tend to see it instead as a type of marine pig, probably based on its facial features.  In addition to the [Malay](languages/326) variant _babi duyoŋ_ (‘pig dugong’) a comparison of dugongs and pigs is seen in [Kavalan](languages/293) _babuy na raziŋ_ (‘pig of the sea’) ‘dugong’ (glossed erroneously as ‘dolphin’ in [Li and Tsuchida 2006)](bib-Li), and in [Wogeo](languages/19063) _ika boro_ (‘pig fish’) ‘dugong’.

First, although it is the most common, it is only one of four stem variants: &ast;_ampu_, &ast;_empu_, &ast;_impu_, and &ast;_umpu_.  Second, an unusual number of affixed forms can be reconstructed next to the simple base.

Another, &ast;_empu-ni-a_, involves what appears initially to be a possessed kinship term (cp. &ast;_ama-ni-a_ ‘his/her father’) which on closer inspection turns out to function very differently from other kinship terms followed by the genitive marker &ast;_ni_ and the 3sg. object pronoun &ast;_-a_.  The common reflex of &ast;_-i_ ‘local transitive’ in [Malay](languages/326) _mem-pu-ña-i_ and [Makassarese](languages/325) _punnà-i_ ‘have, possess’, suggests an etymon &ast;_empu-ni-a-i_.  However, since &ast;_empu-ni-a_ evidently meant ‘its owner’ (lit. ""owner-of-it""), the [Malay](languages/326) and [Makassarese](languages/325) constructions in -/_i_/ must have arisen after the reanalysis of &ast;_empu-ni-a_ as a verb &ast;_empuña_, and hence is a product of independent parallel changes.

26111,verbal suffix marking patient or undergoer voice; nominal suffix marking product of an action or thing affected by an action,,*-en,"&ast;_-en_ is one of the most important affixes that can be reconstructed for [PAn](languages/PAN), [PMP](languages/PMP) and [PWMP](languages/PWMP).  Like other affixes in the ‘focus system’ it evidently marked voice in verbal constructions, and at the same time served to create deverbal nominals.  Both functions are widely attested, the latter often fossilized in reflexes of &ast;_kaen-en_ ‘be eaten/what is eaten = cooked rice’. The use of &ast;_-en_ to mark passive imperatives has not been noted in [Formosan](languages/Form.) languages to date, but is widespread in the Philippines and western Indonesia. In some languages, as [Bikol](languages/244), there is a synchronic contrast between imperative marking with a reflex of &ast;_-en_, and an alternative marking with a reflex of &ast;_-a_.  The former alternative occurs when a short (agent/possessor) pronoun immediately follows the suffixed verb, while the latter occurs without the pronoun.  In other languages (as [Kelabit](languages/299)) imperatives which use a reflex of &ast;_-en_ are felt to be ‘softer’ or more polite than imperatives which do not make use of passive verb  morphology (in this connection cp. also [Malay](languages/326) passive imperatives/dehortatives in _di-_, as with _Jaŋan di-gaŋgu guru-mu!_ ‘Don't disturb your teacher!’).",PAN,Canonical

For this reason caution must be observed so as not to confuse genuine cognates with products of chance convergence.  It is unclear whether the meaning ‘comb’ in Formosan reflexes of &ast;_garuC_ is original or secondary.

The connection with ‘cloth’ in [Ilokano](languages/279), [Nias](languages/361), [Balinese](languages/235) and [Muna](languages/350) probably arose through protohistoric trade contacts in which bolts of cloth were stored on sticks or racks.

Second, there is no obvious reason why a [Malay](languages/326) word would be borrowed to designate a native animal.  It is most plausible to assume, then, that the porcupine was first encountered by Austronesian speakers moving south from Taiwan when they reached Palawan,  and the name that was innovated for it there was preserved as they continued to expand southward.

As such it signalled both possessors and non-subject agents.  This dual function was retained in most Philippine-type languages in Taiwan, the Philippines and northern Borneo, as well as in the Batak languages of northern Sumatra, and indirectly through the genitive suffix &ast;_-ña_ (< &ast;_ni-á_) in [Chamorro](languages/573), and in western Indonesian languages that have reduced the four-voice system of [PAn](languages/PAN) to a simple active-passive dichotomy, as in [Bintulu](languages/242) of Borneo, or [Malay](languages/326).  The agent-marking function of &ast;_ni_ evidently was lost in all CEMP languages, leaving it only as a genitive of general possession or part-to-whole relationships.  In Oceanic languages that have lost final vowels the _–n_ that occurs between nouns that stand in a genitive relationship is often glossed as ‘3sg’, as in [Naman](languages/19494) _jëbë-n nevdoro_ ‘the woman’s grandfather’ [grandfather-3sg woman] ([Crowley 2006:71](bib-Crowley)).

No other reflex of &ast;_Namat_ is known, and there are essentially two reasonable explanations for this distribution.  One is that the word is a loan from [Taokas](languages/19210) to [Kavalan](languages/293) or vice-versa (or perhaps from an intermediate language that has since lost it, such as the inadequately known Liulang).  Within modern times [Taokas](languages/19210) and [Kavalan](languages/293) have not been in contact, and they are separated by a considerable mountain massif now peopled by speakers of [Atayal](languages/493) However, there is some evidence that the Atayalic peoples have moved northward into their present territory within the past few centuries ([Blust 1996:283-288](bib-Blust)), and it is thus possible that prior to the Atayal reaching their historically attested distribution the Taokas had a wider east-west territorial spread than they had when linguistic and ethnographic recording in this part of Taiwan began during the Japanese colonial period starting in 1895.",PAN,Canonical

This reconstruction is somewhat tentative, since the inclusion of [Saisiyat](languages/400) _ka-lhib_ depends on a morpheme division of somewhat dubious status, and without the [Saisiyat](languages/400) form the word is attested only in languages that are geographically contiguous, hence raising the prospect of borrowing, a possibility that is strengthened by the apparent borrowing of a dialectal [Amis](languages/227) form into [Kavalan](languages/293).  In favor of maintaining the comparison, on the other hand, are the observation that medial consonant clusters in [Saisiyat](languages/400) always reflect earlier sequences in which an intervening vowel has dropped, and the appearance of an unexplained _ka-_ on a number of other nouns, as [Saisiyat (Taai)](languages/977) _ka-kliw_ (< &ast;_keRiw_) ‘hemp’, _kæ-ʔLor_ ‘pillar’ (< &ast;_qelud_ ‘main house post’, _ka-sbol_ (< &ast;_CebuN_) ‘smoke’, and _ka-tboʃ_ (< &ast;_tebuS_) ‘sugarcane’.",PAN,Canonical

Finally, because it is also necessary to reconstruct &ast;_padaw_ ‘kind of sailboat’ (q.v.), many Philippine forms are difficult to classify.

[PMP](languages/PMP) &ast;_penuq_ evidently referred to fullness and filling of containers with liquid or solid material; however, in many of the reflexes is also used in a somewhat more abstract sense, as with people filling a room or graves filling a village.

Since [Kavalan](languages/293) _pənu_ is the sole known Formosan reflex of this word, and since in [Kavalan](languages/293) _pənu_ refers to all marine turtles without distinction, it is unclear whether there was a more specific referent of &ast;_peñu_ in [PAn](languages/PAN). By [PMP](languages/PMP) times, however, it is clear that &ast;_peñu_ referred distinctively to the green turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, valued for both its meat and its eggs, as contrasted with the hawksbill turtle, _Chelonia imbricata_ ([PCEMP](languages/PCEMP) &ast;_keRa(nŋ)_), which was valued for its colorful shell (in part because of international trade demand from a very early date).  Although the evidence is tenuous, the extended glosses in [Malagasy](languages/18432) [Nggela](languages/359) and [Tongan](languages/434) suggest that a reflex of [PMP](languages/PMP) &ast;_peñu_ may also have designated a turtle-shaped water beetle or a similar insect (also cf.

But under this interpretation we must recognize at least three independent metatheses ([Ilokano](languages/279), the Bornean forms, [Toba Batak](languages/427)), of which the second followed the sporadic palatalization of &ast;_n_ before _i_.  An invariant prototype &ast;_qari-ñuan_ not only exacerbates this problem, but cannot account for the stem-initial _g_ of various Philippine reflexes.  This difficulty might be alleviated by positing &ast;_qaRi-ñuan_, but among other obstacles to such an interpretation independent evidence for a prefix &ast;_qaRi-_ is unknown.

The recurrent references to double bananas in such [WMP](languages/WMP) languages as [Kayan (Uma Juman)](languages/438) and [Mongondow](languages/245), and the parallel association of twinning with humans and fruits in the similar but non-corresponding [Amis](languages/227) and [Karo Batak](languages/18314) forms, raise the possibility that &ast;_apij_ ‘twins’ and &ast;_qapid_ ‘braid, twine’ are actually the same morpheme (since both the strands of a braided rope, and double bananas are joined along the length).  However, &ast;_qapid_ appears definitely to end in &ast;_d_, and if [Roviana](languages/396) _avisi_ truly belongs in this cognate set (and not with &ast;_Sabij_), &ast;_apij_ must end in &ast;_j_.",PMP,Canonical

This interpretation is strengthened by the rather matter-of-fact descriptions of the human consumption of raw food in most societies in Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, and by the common semantic reflexes of &ast;_qetaq_ throughout the Solomons (and nowhere else) which refer to pigs breaking into gardens and eating the produce before it can be harvested and cooked.",PAN,Canonical

I assume that [Lun Dayeh](languages/19418), [Kelabit](languages/299) _rinuh_ represents a metathesis from the [PMP](languages/PMP) form rather than a conservative agreement with Formosan languages, and that the nasal in [Malay](languages/326) _ñiru_ is a product of historically secondary palatalization, as in _ñiur_ < _&ast;niuR_ ‘coconut’.",PAN,Canonical
29921,long feathers used for personal adornment,,*RiNaS,"Given the clear morphological connection between these forms it is reasonable to assume that &ast;_RiNaS_ referred in particular to the tail feathers of the male Swinhoe’s blue pheasant, since these are particularly long and striking, with their peacock-like patterns of ocelli.  Within historical times such feathers were highly valued in the traditional cultures of several Formosan aboriginal groups.  This term is striking in that the name of the animal from which the natural product comes is derived by suffixation with &ast;_-an_ ‘locative’ (male Swinhoe’s blue pheasant lit. = ‘source of long tail feathers’).  The correctness of this interpretation is confirmed by a parallel usage with &ast;_waNiS_ ‘tusk of wild boar’ : &ast;_waNiS-an_ ‘wild boar’, where the name for the wild boar is literally ‘source of tusks’, another natural product that was traditionally valued for its decorative uses among the Formosan aborigines.",PAN,Canonical

[Zorc (1985)](bib-Zorc) assigned [Tagalog](languages/423) _giʔík_ to ""Proto-Hesperonesian-Formosan"" &ast;_Gíek_ ‘to thresh’, citing [Kanakanabu](languages/680) _uma-iriki_, [Malay](languages/326) _(h)irék_ ‘thresh’ as the only non-Philippine reflexes. However, [Kanakanabu](languages/680) _uma-iriki_, like [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](languages/18964) _iRik_ ‘thresh with the feet’ is most simply derived from &ast;_iRik_, and [Malay](languages/326) _(h)irek_ from &ast;_qiRik_.

A careful consideration of other bases that have a postvocalic schwa, such as &ast;_kaen_ ‘eat’ suggests that contraction of the vowel sequence that resulted from loss of &ast;_q_ was likely to occur independently in many languages, and the disyllabic canonical preference of most AN languages would then have led to restoration of the lost disyllabism by schwa epenthesis, hence &ast;_Riqek_ > &ast;_Riek_ > &ast;_Rik_ > &ast;_eRik_.",PAN,Canonical

This is a somewhat difficult comparison, since all languages except [Rukai](languages/397), [Truku Seediq](languages/19222), and [Maranao](languages/331) reflect an initial consonant that is ambiguous for &ast;_g_ or &ast;_R_, and --- as noted by [Dempwolff (1938:56)](bib-Dempwolff), apparent cognates in [Toba Batak](languages/427) and [Malagasy](languages/18432) point to &ast;_gudaŋ_.

The [Balaesang](languages/19201), [Dampelas](languages/18954), [Totoli](languages/1084) and [Bare'e](languages/236) forms are clear loanwords from a Philippine source.

In addition to meaning ‘house’ it is clear from a number of reflexes in northern Sumatra and eastern Indonesia that by at least Proto-Malayo-Polynesian times &ast;_Rumaq_ also referred to a segmentary lineage or kin group defined with reference to an apical ancestor ([Blust 1980a](bib-Blust)).",PAN,Canonical

Third, &ast;_taRah_ carries a variety of different affixes in all languages that reflect it, and it is very difficult to find examples of the simple base. Despite initial appearances, however, [Atayal](languages/493), [Seediq](languages/407) and all known MP reflexes provide evidence for a doublet &ast;_naRa_, and it is the prefixation of this base that has given the false impression of homorganic nasal subsitution.

Given its meaning it implies the use of adzes as distinct from axes, machetes, and knives, and therefore the existence of a [PAn](languages/PAN) term for ‘adze’ which is yet to be reconstructed.  Working with an adze involves a striking motion toward the actor, a semantic feature of this term that crops up in other senses, as in [Asilulu](languages/18016) _ta-tala_ ‘coconut rasp’, [Arosi](languages/485) _ara_ ‘to hoe’, or the [Tongan](languages/434) and [Rennellese](languages/390) forms that refer to scooping up sand or small fish.

While ‘sit’ and ‘reside in a place’ are often found together, this word also applies to inanimate objects such as fluids congealing to become solid, or to sediment settling to the bottom, both of which involve the idea of a cessation of motion.

The basic sense of this term appears to have been ‘return (X) to its former place or condition’.  More specific glosses include ‘return home’, ‘return something to someone’ and  ‘restore, repair’.  Either singly or reduplicated &ast;_uliq_ also conveyed the notion of repetition (reflexes in [Itawis](languages/648), [Pangasinan](languages/920), [Hanunóo](languages/273), [Tboli](languages/19175), [Karo Batak](languages/18314), [Tolai](languages/19416), [Nggela](languages/359)), or of motion to and fro ([Karo Batak](languages/18314), [Makassarese](languages/325), [Yamdena](languages/1130), [Rarotongan](languages/388)).  In both [Kayan](languages/294) of central Borneo and in the Batak languages of northern Sumatra reflexes of  &ast;_uliq_ refer to divorce; among the patrilocal [Karo Batak](languages/18314) the reference is specific to women, since upon divorce it is they who return to their natal family and own kin group.  [Dempwolff](bib-Dempwolff) reconstructed ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_muliq_ ‘return home’ (_Heimkehren_) as a ‘doublet’ of ‘Uraustronesisch’ &ast;_uliq_ ‘go back, return’ (_zurückkehren_), despite the transparent morphological connection.

The initial palatal glide in [Atayal](languages/493) and [Taokas](languages/19210) is initially puzzling, but many [Taokas](languages/19210) nouns have a non-etymological _y-_ or _yV-_ (usually _ya-_), as in _yabali_ < &ast;_bali_ ‘wind’, yabatu < &ast;_batu_ ‘stone’, yatiat < &ast;_tiaN_ ‘belly, abdomen’, or _yautat_ ~ _yottat_ < &ast;_quzaN_ ‘rain’, and this may have been an article.
